# Signal Processing: Noise Removal with Filtering in MATLAB

This project demonstrates how to create a composite signal, add noise, and apply a low-pass filter to clean it using MATLAB.

---

## Overview

In signal processing, it's important to reduce noise and preserve the main signal components. This mini-project walks through the following steps:

- Generate a clean signal with multiple frequencies
- Add white Gaussian noise
- Analyze the frequency spectrum using FFT
- Apply a Butterworth low-pass filter
- Compare signals in both time and frequency domains

---

## Tools & Environment

- MATLAB R2023a
- Signal Processing Toolbox

---

## Files Included

- signal_filtering.m – main script
- images/ – contains output plots
- README.md – this file
- report.pdf – project summary (optional)
